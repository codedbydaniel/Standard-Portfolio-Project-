Standard Portfolio Project

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my work, skills, and projects as I grow as a web developer.

Project Description

The Standard Portfolio Project is a simple and responsive portfolio site I built with HTML and CSS. It includes a hero banner, about section, project highlights, and a contact form. This project helped me practice structuring pages, styling with CSS, and understanding responsive layout design.

This project was created as part of my learning journey to:
- Practice building real-world web layouts.
- Showcase my personal work and style.
- Learn how to manage and upload projects using GitHub.
